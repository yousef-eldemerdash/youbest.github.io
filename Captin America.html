<p class="b">
  In CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER, it's 1942, and World War II is raging. Despite the fact
  that he's frail and asthmatic, all that Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants is to join the Army so he can have
  a chance to fight Nazi bullies. That chance comes in the form of Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci),
  a scientist who's developed a special serum that turns scrawny Steve into brawny Captain America. After
  being sidelined by Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and turned into a one-man recruiting ad/war 
  bond salesman, Rogers gets back into the thick of things when a rescue mission uncovers intelligence
  about the nefarious plans of HYDRA, a Nazi experimental science division led by evil Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving).
  With the help of a motley crew of soldiers and lovely-and-capable Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell),
  Rogers focuses on stopping Schmidt before the villain can unleash his mysterious,
   extremely powerful super weapons on the world.
